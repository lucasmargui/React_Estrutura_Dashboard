 - useState: It is a hook that allows you to add state to a functional component in React. It returns an array with two positions. The first is the current state and the second is a function to update that state. In this case, the initial state is null, but the type is defined as an array of objects that have the form {month: string; revenue: number; }.
 - useEffect: It is a hook that allows you to execute side effects in functional components. In the example, it is being used to fetch data (probably through an asynchronous function fetchData) and update the revenue state with this data.

The fetchData function is defined inside useEffect to prevent it from being redefined on each render.
The empty array as the second argument to useEffect indicates that the effect will only be executed once, after the initial assembly of the component.
